## Requirements

Develop a Sudoku solver by applying search algorithms with heuristics to solve a puzzle.Consider the classic 9-by-9 Sudoku puzzle. The goal is to fill in the empty cells such that every row, every column, and every 3-by-3 box contains exactly the digits 1 through 9, each digit occurring once. The solution to the puzzle should satisfy these constraints:

1. The digits to be entered are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.
2. A row is 9 cells wide. A filled-in row must have exactly one of each digit. There is 9 rows in the grid, and the same constraint applies to each of them.
3. A column is 9 cells tall. A filled-in column must have exactly one of each digit. There are 9 columns in the grid, and the same constraint applies to each of them.
4. A box contains 9 cells in a 3-by-3 layout. A filled-in box must have exactly one of each digit. There are 9 boxes in the grid, and the same constraint applies to each of them
